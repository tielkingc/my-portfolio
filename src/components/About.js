            Hi, I'm Christian.
            <br className="hidden lg:inline-block" />I love to build amazing websites.

          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            Coding started out as a hobby I picked up in high school, but quickly became something I 
            wanted to do as a career. I began studying in my freetime while working in a 
            variety of IT positions ranging from help desk to computer repair. I've recently had the opportunity to 
            complete a coding bootcamp through Butler University, and feel confident that I am ready to join the industry. 
            I'm excited to work with other developers to create amazing websites and continue my education within the field.
